# Adventure_Game_
This is an adventure game that I made for a project in udacity's intro to programming nanodegree

To use it, you will need python on your computer.
After that, you just run the file and see what you think.
The game will continue to run unless you cancel it with a keyboard command,
or select 'No' whenever you hit a game over section.
